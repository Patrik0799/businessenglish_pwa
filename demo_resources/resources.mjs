                             It does not refer to what is temporary or happening in the moment. It almost always follows the question, "What's your name?" and asks about your occupation/work.
                             The answer might be "I am a student/teacher/accountant, etc." When asked "What do you do on Tuesdays?" "What do you do after work?" it is asking about the habit.
                             An answer to this question might be "I swim/play tennis/work late, etc."</span></p>

                    <p><span>You have learned, in this section, how to introduce yourself and what you do using the present simple and present progressive.  In business you will need to introduce yourself in a variety of situations that require different types of introductions: </span></p>
                    <p><strong>Spontaneous introductions</strong> – as you learned in the previous section, these introductions are very short (up to 30 seconds) and include your name, occupation, and a “hook” related to the situation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Short professional introductions</strong> – These introductions are a bit longer, approximately 60 seconds, and often occur in situations where you are briefly in the spotlight, for example at meetings. In these situations, you are expected to: greet the others, give your name, your company, position, and a topic of special interest or information to the group.</p>
                    <p><stong>Assignment 1: </stong>Read this article for tips on effective short introductions and write a 60-second introduction of yourself: <a class="entry-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/8-simple-steps-great-60-second-self-introduction-speech-jim-stramler/">Link</a></p>
                    <p><strong>Interview introductions </strong> – Introductions made during interviews are very formal and should be well planned. These introductions last a few minutes (2-3) and can tell an interviewer a lot about the speaker. Ideally, this type of introduction has two parts a professional and a personal. However, it is not aimed at delivering a synopsis of your resume (which the interviewer has probably read and also has in front of them). An outstanding answer will take personal strengths and relate those to the needs of the company and the specifics of the job. This type of introduction requires a lot of preparation but highlights the interviewee’s preparedness, personality and professionalism.</p>
                    <p><strong>Assignment 2: </strong>Read this article with an explanation of effective short introductions and then write a 3-minute introduction of yourself for an interview.</p>
                    <p><a class="entry-link" href="https://hbr.org/2019/08/how-to-respond-to-so-tell-me-about-yourself-in-a-job-interview">Link</a></p>
                    <p><strong>Formal professional introductions </strong>- These introductions are longer and more in depth. They often occur in situations where you are the center of attention for example at special meetings or presentations. In these situations, you are expected to: begin with a greeting, give your name, your company, position, an overview of your background, some example of your expertise and its connection to the special interest for which the group has been convened. These introductions can be 3-5 minutes but vary given the situation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Assignment 3: </strong>Write a 3-5 minute formal introduction of yourself as if you were a speaker at a business conference.</p>

                <p class="entry-title"><strong class="title-strong">Section III TELEPHONING -  SIMPLE PAST,  SIMPLE PAST CONTINUOUS, PRESENT PERFECT, PRESENT PERFECT CONTINUOUS</strong></p>
                <div class="entry-description">
                    <p><span>Telephoning in your native language can be difficult. There are often a number of factors that can detract from a call, like background noises, equipment problems, or interruptions. However, speaking in another language can be even more challenging due to the need for immediate comprehension skills, vocabulary recall, use of accurate grammatical structures, among other things.</span></p>
                    <p><span>When telephoning the present tenses are often used to talk about what is happening and past tenses to talk about what happened. The past tenses used in telephoning can including the simple past, past continuous, present perfect, and present perfect continuous (among others).</span></p>        
                    <p><span>The <strong>simple past</strong> is used to talk about <strong>finished actions and finished time.</strong></span></p>        
                    <p><span><strong>Formation: </strong>the -ed form of the verb or the 2nd form of irregular verbs</span></p>
                    <p><span><strong>Signal words </strong>include: last week, in 2001, yesterday, ago</span></p>        
                </div>
                <br>
                <div class="entry-description">
                    <p><span>The <strong>past continuous </strong>is used to talk about <strong>past actions that were part of a process and continued for some time. </strong>This form is useful in story telling and is often combined with the simple past, e.g. “I was riding my bicycle when it started to rain.”</span></p>
                    <p><span><strong>Formation: </strong>the past form of the verb be plus the -ing form of the verb</span></p>
                    <p><span><strong>Signal words </strong>include: as, when, while</span></p>
                    <p><span>The <strong>present perfect </strong>is used to discuss actions that connect the past and the present. This tense is used to talk about finished action (“I have worked here for 30 years), something from the past relevant to now (“I have just made some coffee”), undetermined time (“Have you ever taken night classes?”), unfinished state (“They have not finished the report”.)</span></p>
                    <p><span><strong>Formation: </strong>has or have + 3rd form of the verb</span></p>
                    <p><span><strong>Signal words</strong>include: ever, never, already, just, so far, up to now, yet, this week/day/month when the time is not over (e.g. “I have not seen her this morning” said at 10 a.m.), for (used when talking about a span of time “I have worked here for 19 years.”), and since (used when talking about time from a specific point “I have worked here since 2000”.)</span></p>
                    <p><span>The <strong>present perfect continuous, </strong>like the present perfect is used to talk about actions that connect the past and the present. However, because the present perfect continuous is used to describe processes this tense is used to talk about unfinished action (“I have been working here for 30 years”), something from the past relevant to now (“I have just been making some coffee”), undetermined time (“Have you been taking night classes?”), unfinished state (“They have been finishing the report”.) Use of the present perfect focuses on the action done while the present perfect continuous focuses on the process (and therefore conveys the thought that the action/process may continue)</span></p>
                    <p><span><strong>Formation: </strong>has/have been plus the -ing form of the verb</span></p>
                    <p><span><strong>Signal words </strong>include: for, since, all, the whole (e.g. “I have been working on the problem the whole day,” “She has been talking on her mobile for 2 hours,” “They have been meeting since 8 a.m.”)</span></p>

                <p><span>Listening effectively is a complex skill as it involves hearing and deciphering a lot of information spontaneously. Doing this quickly and effectively in a non-native language is quite difficult. However, with frequent, regular practice one’s ability to hear and comprehend improves markedly.</span></p>
                <p><span>There are multiple levels of listening skills and like other skills the way to improvement is through repetition. Therefore, listen to any recording at least three times before getting help from a transcript of it.</span></p>
                <p><span>The first time through, just listen for the “gist” or major content of the conversation. Find out who is talking, how many speakers there are, what the subject of the conversation is, are the speakers easy or difficult to understand, if are there special topics that stand out, and if there are words or phrases that are unfamiliar. Make a note of what you have gathered from your first listening. Next, listen to the recording again and gather a bit more information than you did the first time. Again, note what new information you heard. Lastly, listen a third time in order to gain specific details or nuances in the conversation. Finally, check your comprehension with the transcript of the conversation (note, listening to the conversation as you read the transcript will help your pronunciation as you hear how printed words are pronounced).</span></p>
                <p><span>Listening to a recording multiple times and writing what you have heard is time consuming and demands both patience and discipline. However, using this technique regularly over a few months will bring marked improvement. It will be insidious progress, but you will suddenly realize that you can understand things, like newscasts, podcasts, YouTube videos, Netflix series, or conversations, much easier than previously.</span></p>
                <p><span>Click on the link and listen to the (B1 level) conversation between a customer and a company. Complete the exercises before and after the recording. Remember to use the above method of practice when listening to the actual conversation.</span></p>
                <p><span><a class="entry-link" href="https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/listening/intermediate-b1-listening">Link</a></span></p>
                <p><span>Being able to listen and understand quickly and accurately is an important skill to develop. Once you have completed the previous B1 listening activity, move on to "Interview about active listening skills", then "Making a decision". Then complete the other associated recordings and exercises on the website. There are a total of 36 Business English listening exercises with 12 exercises at each of the B1, B2, and C1 levels. By listening and completing these exercises you will make major improvement in your auditory skills, increase your vocabulary, and improve your grammar.</span></p>

                <p><span>Another part of the salutation is the use of titles. Most common titles are: <ul><li>Mr = male</li><li>Mrs = married female</li><li>Miss = young/unmarried female</li><li>Ms = female with no reference to marital status or age</li></ul></span></p>

Improper punctuation can confuse a reader, convey a wrong message or a wrong impression.</span></p><p> <strong>Periods</strong> <span> : These may be used after titles, street numbers, abbreviations, etc. particularly in formal correspondence. However, there is also “open punctuation” where periods are not used after such items. This format is common in business emails and text messages. Periods also signal the end of a sentence. </span></p><p><strong>Commas</strong><span>: These are either used or omitted after both the salutation and closing. More formal correspondence uses commas. You may not use a comma for the salutation and not the closing or vice versa.</span></p><p><strong>Colon</strong><span>: Used to signal a series/list of three or more items follows or used to separate two independent clauses related in thought.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Semi-colon:</strong><span> Used to separate two independent clauses related in thought (alternatively to a comma and a conjunction).</span></p><p> <strong>Hyphens (-)</strong> <span> : These are used to connect words that must be read together in order to be understood properly or to separate numbers. There are differences in the type of English being used, e.g. trademark, trade mark, and trade-mark are all acceptable. </span></p><p> <strong>Dashes (— or –):</strong> <span> The dash is used to signal the largest break in a sentence. There are several types of dashes used to do this. An em dash (—) is the longest dash and clearest break in a sentence — it is used to highlight a thought. An em dash (–) is most often used to signal a range, similar to the words “from to”.&nbsp; </span></p></div><div class=\"entry-description-fill\"> <p><strong>Fill in the correct NAME of the form of punctuation in the following email, i.e. use “comma, period, colon, dash, hyphen, etc.)</strong></p><p><span>Dear Jane Farmington *comma/no comma* (1)</span></p><p><span>Thank you for your email *period* (2) We are delighted to hear that you are interested in the Account Manager position.&nbsp;</span></p><p> <span> Your interview is scheduled on 24 July from 3 o’clock *hyphen* (3) 6 o’clock.

                <p><span>Report writing is an important part of business. Reports are written to present information in a clear, concise, objective manner that assists in decision making or presents a suggestion for making a decision.</span></p>
                <p><span>Since reports are so key in the process of decision making, they are rigid in both their structure and the language used to write them. For example, the language used in a report is: objective, precise, concrete, formal, and grammatically correct. The structure of the report is also rigid and leaves only a little room for variance.</span></p>
                <p><span>Because readers are focusing on the information and facts that reports present, it is necessary that formatting, language, print face, or errors do not interfere with the messages the report conveys. The focus of a report must be the information it contains.</span></p>
                <p><span>There are usually 6 characteristic parts in an English business report: title, purpose/introduction, status quo/current situation, findings, resources, conclusion. Note that the parts of a report are all given headings that are either bolded or capitalized and placed above the paragraphs in that section. This allows a reader to easily locate and read isolated parts of the report. The title, purpose, resources and conclusion are standard names for their sections. The middle sections, i.e. status quo and findings can be changed according to the subject of the report.</span></p>
                <p><span>Report format, formal vs informal English, word order, active vs passive voice, and linking words will be reviewed.</span></p>

However, the passive voice is also used in more formal and objective (e.g. report) writing. The passive uses a sentence order where the object receives the action and the original subject becomes an agent of the action, i.e. object + be + verb in the third form/ed form + by agent. Note that the tense of the sentence is noted by the tense of “be” that is used and not the verb (which remains in the -ed or third form).\n<p>Example: We are reading the book.

                    <p><span>The standard word order in English is: subject + verb (predicate) + object = We finished the report.  Other parts of speech or pieces of information can be added to this, e.g. details about place or time. A standard sentence would then be: subject + verb (predicate) + object  + place + time = We finished the report in Stephan’s office yesterday. Adverbs and adjectives can then be added in for details or interest, e.g. We rapidly finished the sales report in Stephan’s office yesterday evening.</span></p>
                    <p><span>English, however, is flexible in that it uses grammatical techniques to place emphasis on certain parts of the sentence by repositioning them to an atypical place in the sentence structure. The first technique is called “fronting”. Literally, this means moving a part of speech that is normally found later in a sentence to the front. The previous sample sentence would then become “Yesterday evening we rapidly finished the sales report in Stephan’s office”. The second technique is called “inversion”. This is when a verb and subject are used in a reversed order (i.e. verb + subject). This is used in advanced grammar for emphasis, e.g. “Never have I heard such nonsense.” (Adverb + verb + subject). Inversion is also standardly used in questions, e.g. “Can you tell me the time?”</span></p>

                    <p><span><strong>Preview: </strong>Begin your presentation by listing the main points you plan to cover. This will mean using “signposting” language in order to tell the audience the sequence of the information you will be covering. This section usually involves the future tenses.</span></p>
                    <p><span><strong>Body of the Presentation: </strong>Here the details of the information you want to convey are given. This usually involves a variety of tenses. Use linking sentences to move from one point to another. Often presenting visuals are often part of the body of a presentation.</span></p>
                    <p><span><strong>Review: </strong>Summarize and review the main points again. List the points and remind the audience what you have told them. This section often involves stating facts and the present simple tense.</span></p>
                    <p><span><strong>Closing: </strong>Thank the audience for their attention and open the session up for questions. After the questions, summarize that discussion and then restate your important points of your presentation.</span></p>

The best presenters use a variety signposting language throughout their presentation.&nbsp; </span> </p><p><span>Examples of signposting language used in all the different sections of a presentation can be found by clicking the link below:</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p> <a class=\"entry-link\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/business/talkingbusiness/unit3presentations/expert.shtml\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 255);\">Link </a> </p></div><div class=\"entry-description-fill\"> <p><strong>Use the linking words in the box above to complete the body of a presentation.</strong></p><ol> <li>*Recently*, companies have been increasingly involved in scandals regarding their business practices.&nbsp;</li><li>Unacceptable business practices include, *for example*, unfair treatment of employees, illegal accounting practices, and damage to the environment,*in addition* to the effect&nbsp; their products have on society.</li><li>Over the past decades, *increasing* instances of “bad labor practices” *as well as* corporate scandals have been widely publicized.</li><li>*As a result*, the public has become increasingly critical of corporate practices and has higher expectations regarding corporate responsibility.&nbsp;</li><li>*Consequently*, an increasing number of firms are incorporating the concept of CSR into their operating plan and strategy.</li><li>*Additionally*, businesses are striving to maintain transparency in every aspect of their business dealings.</li><li>Ethical firms are ensuring that CSR policy not only exists in the board room, but, *moreover*, that it is evident in every part of the business.</li></ol> </div></div>"

The nature of the message may be technical, economic, scientific, motivational, or otherwise – but of key importance is always the communication between a speaker and listener(s).&nbsp; </span> </p><p> <span> Therefore, communicating well is the key to a successful presentation and making mistakes in grammar is not an unforgivable problem. Remember that most often the audience is made up of people who are hoping that you succeed. They want to be recipients of, or even participants in, a successful presentation. This is true of native English and non-native English speakers alike.&nbsp; </span> </p><p><span>To communicate your ideas successfully a few constructions and tenses are needed. Below is a list of the tenses and the parts of the presentation they most often occur in:</span></p><p> <strong><u>Introduction:</u></strong> <span> Most often uses the present simple for stating facts about yourself and what you do. Additionally, the going to or will future is used to present an outline of your agenda for the presentation (Today, I am going to talk about&nbsp; or Today, we will hear about). </span> </p><p> <strong><u>Body:</u></strong> <span> The tenses used in the body of a presentation vary according to the subject being presented. To give an update about past situations use the past tense: the simple past (we sold), past progressive (we were selling), the present perfect (we have sold), or present perfect continuous (we have been selling).&nbsp; </span> </p><p> <span> To discuss upcoming plans use the going to future (We’re going to introduce a new product), for arrangements use the present continuous/v+ing form (We’re moving to a new office in June), for certain actions in the future use will or the simple present tense (with timetables “The plane leaves at 10am” and schedules “The AGM is always on 1 June”). </span> </p><p><span>To discuss things which are hypothetical or deal with probability use conditionals (“if”-sentences).</span></p><p><span>To give directions to the audience you should use the imperative (infinitive) form: “Note the changes in the graph”.&nbsp;</span></p><p> <strong><u>Summary/Conclusion:</u></strong> <span> The tenses used in the conclusion vary. To recap what has been discussed, use the present perfect tense. To discuss what is planned for the future use the will, v+ ing, or going to future. To remind people of the key message from the meeting use the imperative tense: “Remember – successful communication is key.” </span> </p></div><div class=\"entry-description-fill\"> <h4> <strong><span class=\"ql-cursor\"> </span>Click on the link below and read chapter 10 pages 103-114 for more information about tenses and sample sentences used in these parts.

                <div class="entry-description">
                    <p><span>The purpose of a curriculum vitae (CV) or resume is to spark the interest of a potential employer enough for them to investigate you further or to contact you. A CV or resume is therefore both a type of marketing tool and a source of information.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Nowadays, as there are often hundreds of applicants for any position, a CV/resume, cover letter, or personal profile are extremely important. These items need to be of the highest quality. The English used needs to be excellent in all aspects. Extra effort in ensuring the quality of your documents may be a key factor in your success.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Although the terms CV and resume are often used interchangeably, there are differences between them.  A CV is a more technical presentation of information and usually two pages, however, more is expected for higher level positions and academia. This format is widely used in Europe and Britain.  A resume is a more concise presentation and is normally one page. It is used in the United States and Canada.</span></p>
                    <p><span>When writing either a CV or a resume, always consider the person to whom you are sending it. Write it in concise, clear, and accurate terms. Strive to use words that the recipient (i.e., potential employer) uses in their ad or job description. Use an attractive, standard format that presents your information most clearly and in a way that is easily understandable by the reader.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Because CVs and resumes primarily present historical data they are usually written in the past tense. Of course, ongoing positions and interests are written in the simple present or present perfect. Another key factor is the use of action verbs that make the experiences seem more vibrant to the reader.</span></p>

                    <p><span>On your professional papers the easiest and clearest way to write dates is in the day-month-year format.

                    <p><span>When writing dates on the CV/resume, remember that most often the years are all that is needed, e.g. dates of study, employment, certification. Months are used to denote shorter periods of employment, internship, etc. or to signify that employment began at a certain point within a year and then continued for an extended period (e.g. 2 Feb 2010 – 15 Dec 2010). The word most often used for positions which are continuing is “present”, e.g., 2005-present, with the use of an en dash or hyphen instead of the word “to”.</span></p>

Here’s a few tips to do this successfully.  <p>1. Use a separate section for each work experience.</p> <p>2. Use key words that appear in the reader’s job ad/description, company website, or key words for the sector you are applying to.</p> <p>3. Use action-oriented words, such as: created, established, headed, organized, oversaw, sparked, etc. instead of passive terms, such as: was tasked with, was able to complete, made, etc.</p> <p>4. Avoid using the personal pronoun “I” when it appears before a verb, e.g. “Devised a new method of data management.” “Sparked customer interest” “Managed a budget of €2m”</p> <p>5. Skills can be listed in a separate section, which is similarly arranged to the Experience section. This means that it lists the types of skills in separate groups, uses key action-oriented words, gives dates and details, and avoids the use of pronouns when possible.</p> <p> </p> <p>Instructions: Choose the better of the given options</p>",

                <div class="entry-description">
                    <p><span>Interviewing for a position is a stressful task. Interviewing in a non-native language is even more stressful. Good preparation and practice will help, as will remembering that the most important part of any interview is the communication that occurs between the candidate and the interviewer(s). The person (or people) conducting the interview want to have a successful interview as much as the person being interviewed.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Therefore, focus on your communication. Effective communication has characteristics that include being: clear, concise, cohesive, well-organized, and informative.</span></p>
                    <p><span><strong>Clear </strong>the information given is easily recognizable and understandable</span></p>
                    <p><span><strong>Concise </strong>the information is to the point, i.e. it does not include a lot of extra information.</span></p>
                    <p><span><strong>Organized </strong>the information given follows a logical order</span></p>
                    <p><span><strong>Cohesive </strong>the parts of a message are related to each other</span></p>
                    <p><span><strong>Informative </strong>the information is meaningful and purposeful</span></p>
                    <p><span>In addition to the above, the way you present your communication is important. Both body language and tone play an important part of this communication in that they can either support or detract from what you say. Therefore, practicing interviewing by recording yourself can give you an insight into your body gesture, tone of voice, and any other unknown or unwanted habits as you answer interview questions.</span></p>
                    <p><span>The English you use in an interview is also important. In general, in an interview you will need to be familiar with types of English questions and answers, formal vs informal English, signposting, and the vocabulary of interviewing. These topics are addressed in the following exercises.</span></p>

                <div class="entry-description">
                    <p><span>Job fairs are special events where employers display information about their company and employment opportunities. Attending job fairs is a very good way to prepare yourself for the job market, hone your interviewing skills, network and make important contacts, gain entry information at companies, as well as gather knowledge about your career field. Additionally, for many people, attending a job fair and talking to people there is less stressful than being individually interviewed.</span></p>
                    <p><span>To be fully prepared to attend a job fair you need to have readied your personal documents, such as your: business cards, CV/resume, personal profile, and any “supplementary” materials such as LinkedIn profile, websites or blogs, and any publications, etc. and to have all of these in top condition. Additionally, you should prepare an elevator pitch and pertinent questions for each employer you plan to visit.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Many of these items mentioned above you have prepared through using this app and received information about others by following the suggested external links. This section will discuss questions for a job fair, preparing a personal profile and elevator pitch, and following up after a trade fair. This will be a final preparation for attending and getting the most out of job fairs.</span></p>
                    <p><span>One of the most important parts of attending a job fair is the preparation done before the fair. There are so many benefits to attending job fairs that the effort it takes to prepare and the energy it takes to attend are well worth it.</span></p>
                    <p><span>This means not only preparing your personal papers, but just as importantly, researching the companies that will attend, and planning how to maximize your results from the fair. First, get a floorplan of the job fair, decide what employers to visit, and map out how to visit the booths you want. Lastly, prepare individualized materials (resume, portfolio, questions) for each key company that you are interested in.</span></p>

There are different ways to relay this information – by saying what the other said using their exact words (direct speech/quote) or by conveying the message through words that are not exactly the same as the speaker’s (indirect speech).</span></p>
                    <p><span>Reported speech uses “reporting verbs,” such as: say, suggest, announce, report, ask, tell, think, or wonder...</span></p>
                    <p><span>When reporting what someone else has said in the indirect way, several parts of speech may need to be changed. Most often these changes are to the verb tense, pronouns, modals, and words signaling time.</span></p>
                    <p><span>No change is needed when the reporting verb is in the present:</span></p>
                    <p><span>e.g., Amy says: “I am happy.”  Joan reports: Amy says, “I am happy.” (direct quote) or Amy says that she is happy. (indirect reported speech). Also, no change in tense is needed when a reported fact remains true even after it is reported.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Changes of tense do occur when the reporting verb is in the past tense:</span></p>
                    <p><span>e.g., Amy said that she was happy. Notice that in the example the pronoun is also changed from “I” to “she”.</span></p>
                    <p><span>Changes of tenses in reported speech are made as below:</span></p>
